# Intelligent Data Analysis Techniques

## About The Project
This project is about implementing and comparing the performance of optimization algorithms. The project is written in Python and uses these algorithms to optimize the unimodal and multimodal functions like Rastrigin, Sphere, Griewank (is it possibility to add more ofc)

## Features
- Implementation of optimization algorithms 
- Comparison of the performance of alhorithms on the functions
- Visualization of the optimization process

## Built With
-Python
-Matplotlib fot visualization

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement more optimization algorithms (Bat, Boa, Cuckoo Search etc)

## Getting started
Make sure you have all the dependencies needed installed (Python3).
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kwieciak/intelligent-data-analysis-techniques.git
```
2. Open IDE and select "Open an existing project." Navigate to the cloned repository and select the "intelligent-data-analysis-techniques" directory.
3. Configure Python interpreter
4. Install Python packages
```sh
pip install -r project1/requirements.txt
```
